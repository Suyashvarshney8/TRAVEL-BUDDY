A Carpooling app within a institute in which registered peoples with car can offer a ride by entering their travelling time.
He/She may also charge fees for the same. This may reduce a lot of fuel consumption and maybe helpful for students

I have used Flutter and dart programming to build this app. Firebase database is used for storing users details. A user may
go in available ride window and can contact the other user.

The App includes Login/SignUp Page (with OTP verification), share a ride page, find a ride page and a profile page. I have
used Geolocation and Firebase Authorisation Plugin in this project
